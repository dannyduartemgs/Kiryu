# Kiryu
Kiryu Skin for Loader

Loader it's so hard to work with for skin making, but here it is, the dragon of dojima.

There's some weird distortions with the arms and his neck is a little long but anything else it's fine. I would like to port kiryu to another character that could be easier, so if you have a recommendation let me know.

Enjoy!

If you wish to contact me here's my discord, maybe you have a character idea that I would like: dannyduartemgs <br />
